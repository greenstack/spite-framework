# Spite Framework

## Overview
The Spite Framework is a C# library meant to simplify designing and implementing turn-based gameplay. The hope is that through the Spite 
Framework, developers can quickly develop all  kinds of turn-based games, from RPGs to board games. This happens through three
core classes: **Arenas**, **Teams**, and **Entities**.
